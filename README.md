CSS Framework

## [Motivation](#motivation):
This CSS framework is created to become a simple way to align items in a website. Basically, it is a layout tool that bases on horizontal and vertical flex-box alignments. No more (col-12, col-5, etc), and no less.

## [Principles](#principles):
1. Class-ness
A class-ness CSS framework is a CSS framework built upon class-less CSS. This means that the framework uses semantic HTML and do not rely on classes. However, classes are added when there is no semantic html to represent it. A **'class-ness'** (from class-necessary) CSS framework is one that uses classes when absolutely **necessary**.
2. Fours
